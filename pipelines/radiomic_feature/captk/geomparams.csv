Generic,Quantization_Extent,String,Image:ROI,ROI,Whether the quantization of Intensities is supposed to happen on a per-image basis or on a per-ROI basis
Generic,Quantization_Type,String,FixedBinNumber:FixedBinSize:Equal,FixedBinNumber,FixedBinNumber (FBN): the bins are uniformly distributed across the minimum and maximum extent in the ROI/Image as defined under 'Quantization_Extent'; FixedBinSize (FBS): bins are added in a fixed step between the minimum and maximum extent in the ROI/Image as defined under 'Quantization_Extent' the requested size is provided in 'Bins'; Equal: each bin holds an equal number of intensities
Generic,Resampling,mm,0:10,0,Resamples all images and masks to this value of voxel/pixel resolution before computations (0: no resampling): reduce this number of more accuracy
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Image,mm,Nearest:Linear:BSpline,Linear,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening; ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Mask,mm,Nearest:NearestLabel:Linear:BSpline,Nearest,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening; ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Generic,SliceComputation,Int,(0:1),0,Controls whether non-Intensity features are calculated along the slice with the largest area along the 3 axes: valid for 3D images only
Generic,NaN-Handling,String,Keep:Remove,Keep,Specify how to handle features with NaN values 'Remove' removes the feature from output - keep in mind this might cause issues with output file in multi-subject (i.e. Training/Batch) mode
Intensity,,,,,
Morphologic,Range,Int,(0:25),0,0:largest connected component in ROI; N: all connected components larger than (N*10^-6) of total image size are taken into account
Morphologic,Feret,Int,(0:1),0,Whether or not to calculate the Feret Diameter (substantially increases computation time)
Volumetric,Dimension,String,[2D:3D],3D,For calculating 2D slice (maximum area along specified axis) or full 3D volume features
Morphologic,Elongation
Morphologic,Perimeter
Morphologic,Roundness
Morphologic,Eccentricity
Morphologic,Ellipse Diameter
Morphologic,Equivalent Spherical Radius
