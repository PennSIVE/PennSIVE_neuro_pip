# PennSIVE NeuroPath
Neuroimaging processing can be challenging due to the extensive setup required before running processing pipelines and the various steps needed for different purposes. The PennSIVE NeuroPath aims to provide users with a convenient and shareable tool that simplifies the process, enhancing transparency and reproducibility in image processing tasks. To further ensure high-quality image processing, novel and interactive quality check tools have also been developed and integrated into PennSIVE NeuroPath. These tools assist users in maintaining consistent processing standards and improving the overall reliability of their neuroimaging analyses.

## How to Use the Tools
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zheng206/PennSIVE_neuro_pip.git

```

**Note**: All PennSIVE NeuroPath pipelines require you to provide a tool path (`--toolpath`), which should be the path where you saved the 'PennSIVE_neuro_pip' repository (e.g., /path/to/PennSIVE_neuro_pip).

Detailed information about each pipeline can be found in the README file included with each pipeline.
